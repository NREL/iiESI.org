<h1>iiESI Overview Video (Text Version)</h1>
<p>Below is the text version of the <a href="index.html">iiESI Overview</a> video.</p>
<p><em>Dan Wetzel:</em> Energy systems integration is a new field that sort of has a more comprehensive look at the way that we as end users consume energy.</p>
<p><em>Ben Kroposki:</em> Energy systems integration is a way of looking at the complete view of energy systems, from electric power grids to thermal energy systems, heating and cooling, as well as fuel systems, and how these all can be integrated together, and then touching upon other domains, like water systems, communication systems, and how we can optimize the complete view of energy across these areas.</p>
<p>Energy systems integration is a really important topic, because right now in the United States, we waste over two-thirds of the primary energy sources that we use.</p>
<p><em>Bryan Hannegan:</em> ESI is important because it's the process and the pathway to a clean and sustainable energy future. </p>
<p><em>Ben Kroposki:</em> So the International Institute for Energy Systems Integration was formed really to bring together the best experts around the world in this variety of energy fields and link them together so that we can create a more holistic view of how we do energy optimization.</p>
<p><em>Mark O'Malley:</em> So iiESI is a mechanism that certainly reflects the whole concept of energy systems integration itself. You can never be an expert in all parts of this. You can only be an expert in your own part. But if you work with people who are experts in the other parts, when you can gain an understanding of it. So iiESI has a very important role in terms of bringing people together and understanding all the parts of the energy system.</p>
<p><em>Ben Kroposki:</em> It's really a way that we can create a knowledge base so that people that are interested in how to optimize energy can come to a single location and find out the latest information around this.</p>
<p>So the global collaboration with iiESI is really important to its overall success. This way, we're able to take the best examples from around the world of people that are really integrating energy systems, and really understanding what's the best practices from those, and translating that for the global community.</p>
<p><em>Linda Steg:</em>  I think it's important that people from different backgrounds are included, because everyone can help to solve this energy puzzle. Everyone has one bit of information that is crucial to help to solve this problem.</p>
<p><em>Dan Wetzel:</em> Global collaboration is so integral to the world solving its energy issues. You need to know the technical dimensions of these energy systems, but then also these political/people dimensions as well, to really make sure that these solutions get implemented properly.</p>
<p><em>Bryan Hannegan:</em> What I find exciting about this is the marriage of so many different fields of expertise. It is so big, and the challenges are so massive and so multifaceted that no one laboratory, no one institution, no one country, no one investigator, is going to be able to solve this all. By definition, the nature and the scale and the pace at which we're trying to move demands collaboration on the scale of the globe, on what we're trying to do with iiESI, and that's why we encourage everyone to get involved and help us with this grand challenge that awaits. </p>
<p><em>Mark O'Malley:</em> It many ways it was an idea we thought was important internationally, but the number of people who've interacted with us, and how positively they've interacted with us, shows us that in fact people do want to work together. </p>
<p><em>Iris van Beuzekom:</em> It's scary to go across your own boundary and to try and work with others from totally different fields. And I think it's really inspiring to see that that's what's happening here, and for me, it's a great confirmation of indeed this is important to work on, and we need to join together and see what we can do. </p>
<p><em>Bryan Hannegan:</em> If we get this right and if we continue to make progress, we will find a way to avoid having to choose between reliable power and clean power, or clean power and affordable power, or energy in some places and not in others. We'll truly solve one of the biggest societal challenges that we face in a way that will endure for generations to come. </p>
<p><em>Sarah Truitt:</em> iiESI is a multidisciplinary network of world class researchers. Join us and help us accelerate the evolution of energy systems integration worldwide by becoming a member or sponsor of iiESI. We have two levels of membership and many sponsorship opportunities.
