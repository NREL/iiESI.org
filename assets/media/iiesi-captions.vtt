00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.620
&gt;&gt; Dan Wetzel: Energy systems integration
is a new field that sort of has a more comprehensive

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.800
look at the way that we as end users consume energy.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.980
&gt;&gt; Ben Kroposki: Energy systems integration is a way of looking at the complete view of

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.109
energy systems, from electric power grids
to thermal energy systems, heating and cooling,

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:28.220
as well as fuel systems, and how these all
can be integrated together, and then touching

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.840
upon other domains, like water systems, communication systems, and how we can

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.940
optimize the complete view of energy across these areas.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.230
Energy systems integration is a really important
topic, because right now in the United States,

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.219
we waste over two-thirds of the primary energy
sources that we use.

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.870
&gt;&gt; Bryan Hannegan: ESI is important because
it's the process and the pathway to a clean

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.290
and sustainable energy future.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.239
&gt;&gt; Ben Kroposki: So the International Institute
for Energy Systems Integration was formed

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.640
really to bring together the best experts
around the world in this variety of energy

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.080
fields and link them together so that we can

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.660
create a more holistic view of how we do energy optimization.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.360
&gt;&gt; Mark O'Malley: So iiESI is a mechanism
that certainly reflects the whole concept

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.840
of energy systems integration itself. You
can never be an expert in all parts of this.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.970
You can only be an expert in your own part.
But if you work with people who are experts

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.820
in the other parts, when you can gain an understanding
of it. So iiESI has a very important role

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.880
in terms of bringing people together and understanding
all the parts of the energy system.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.640
&gt;&gt; Ben Kroposki: It's really a way that we
can create a knowledge base so that people

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.970
that are interested in how to optimize energy
can come to a single location and find out

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.780
the latest information around this.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:47.010
So the global collaboration with iiESI is
really important to its overall success. This

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.090
way, we're able to take the best examples
from around the world of people that are really

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.290
integrating energy systems, and really understanding
what's the best practices from those, and

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.299
translating that for the global community.

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:04.010
&gt;&gt; Linda Steg: I think it's important that
people from different backgrounds are included,

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:09.429
because everyone can help to solve this energy
puzzle. Everyone has one bit of information

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.640
that is crucial to help to solve this problem.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.140
&gt;&gt; Dan Wetzel: Global collaboration is so
integral to the world solving its energy issues.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.760
You need to know the technical dimensions
of these energy systems, but then also these

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.720
political/people dimensions as well, to really

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.239
make sure that these solutions get implemented properly.

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.060
&gt;&gt; Bryan Hannegan: What I find exciting about
this is the marriage of so many different

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:37.120
fields of expertise. It is so big, and the
challenges are so massive and so multifaceted

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.680
that no one laboratory, no one institution,
no one country, no one investigator, is going

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.599
to be able to solve this all. By definition,
the nature and the scale and the pace at which

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:53.319
we're trying to move demands collaboration
on the scale of the globe, on what we're trying

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:58.969
to do with iiESI, and that's why we encourage
everyone to get involved and help us with

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:00.389
this grand challenge that awaits.

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:04.189
&gt;&gt; Mark O'Malley: It many ways it was an idea
we thought was important internationally,

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:07.609
but the number of people who've interacted
with us, and how positively they've interacted

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:10.599
with us, shows us that in fact people do want
to work together.

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:15.670
&gt;&gt; Iris van Beuzekom: It's scary to go across
your own boundary and to try and work with

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.999
others from totally different fields. And
I think it's really inspiring to see that

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:23.849
that's what's happening here, and for me,
it's a great confirmation of indeed this is

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:28.869
important to work on, and we need to join
together and see what we can do.

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:34.200
&gt;&gt; Bryan Hannegan: If we get this right and
if we continue to make progress, we will find

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.450
a way to avoid having to choose between reliable
power and clean power, or clean power and

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.650
affordable power, or energy in some places
and not in others. We'll truly solve one of

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.910
the biggest societal challenges that we face

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.750
in a way that will endure for generations to come.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.720
